# Best Meal

**Overview**</br>
You're looking to help plan a perfect dining experience within a given budget. You will be provided with a menu and a budget. The menu will include various dishes across four categories: Appetizers, Drinks, Main Courses, and Desserts. Each dish has an associated cost and satisfaction level. You must select at least one item from each category to maximize total satisfaction without exceeding the budget.

**Challenge Details**</br>
**Input** Your solution should read from an external file named **menu.json** that contains:
* An array of dish objects with properties: name, cost, satisfaction, and category.
* An integer budget.</br>

**Output** Your program should output:
* A list of selected dishes.
* The total cost and total satisfaction of the selected dishes.</br>

**Requirements**
* Each menu item must be from at least one of the four categories: appetizer, Drink, Main Course, and Dessert.
* The total cost of selected items must not exceed the budget.

**Constraints**
* The number of items per category on the menu can range from 0 to 50.
* The dishes in the menu.json file may appear in any order.
